# Economics

* Economic upturns and downturns consist of cycles
    * Flow of money affects creation of cycles
    * Cycles are different by markets 
    * Portfolio approach is especially effective (vs Alpha strategy which is focusing on one class of asset)
* Flow of money (or capital): 
    * within a specific stock
    * between industries
    * between various classes of markets: equities / foreign exchanges / savings / real estate / commodities 
* Should be able to know to utilize the dynamics of various indexes
* Should be able to understand and leverage the implications and directions of governmental policies, especially economics policies 
* Stock market / real estate / debt market move in sync
* __Bad news is a favorable factor, and crisis is an opportunity__ 
    * We are in cycles
    * You can only connect dots afterward
    * Worst thing happened was the best thing 
    * You will not be ruined if you are awake
